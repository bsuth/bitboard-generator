Bitboard Generator
==================

Bitboard Generator is a small web utility to help me manage
[bitboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard) while working on the
[serpentine](https://github.com/bsuth/serpentine-core) project. It was
originally developed just for [Xiangqi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi),
but extended to Chess as well for fun.

You may use it online [here](https://bsuth.github.io/bitboard-generator/).

Bitboard Generator uses [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
templates for HTML and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)(Scss) for styling.

Usage
-----

You can install the dependencies, build/watch the project or start a local
server using the following:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build project
npm run build

# Watch files for build
npm run watch

# Serve the built files with http-server
npm start
```
